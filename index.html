          The film made a lot of headlines in December 2011, when Siobhan started promoting a new clothing line with Cool FM, after the company discovered that she was nearly bankrupt.
          
          The garments were seen on Siobhan on several television interviews, however she claims she had the idea long before being spotted by "The Sun" to discuss her financial problems.
          
          Cunningham claims that the whole of her legal case was funded by supporters from the fashion industry and believes she can make the business work without her previous model and PR work.
          
          Cunningham was called the "Home Secretary of modelling" by some media outlets and was even compared to Dawn French.
