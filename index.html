    <h2 class="t4"><b>Volunteering</b></h2>
    <p class="p4"> My volunteering work at the <strong>Confederation Centre Public library</strong> is pretty simple, organize small activities and just help whenever needed. What excited is during the weekend there is a special activity which is destinated to help older people enjoy the convenience of the computer. Which is something I always wanted to do. I registered for every time slot that was available. I learned a lot during these activities, for example, I have to learn how to communicate with older people which improved my communication skill. It is not only beneficial for the elders but also for me as a great person.
