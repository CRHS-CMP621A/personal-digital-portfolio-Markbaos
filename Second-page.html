    <h2>Why R99?</h2>
    
    <P>The R99 is accessible almost instantly after picking up, without the use of many attachments.<br> Both the Alternator and Prowler are heavily dependent on attachments to be as dangerous as the <b><i>R99</i></b>.</P>

    <P><br><b><i>volt's</i></b> high DPS, low-recoil, and accessible nature make it quite possibly the best SMG in the game. Therefore, for players new to Apex Legends, it is the perfect go-to SMG. <br> Each bullet deals 15 damage per body shot and 23 per headshot. Things get even better when you consider just how fast the <b><i>volt</i></b> can churn out bullets (720 RPM), allowing players to effectively down a target in just a few seconds. Combine this with the <b><i>volt's</i></b> fast reload animation, quick ADS speed, and accurate hipfire, and you have an SMG that can chew through even the tankiest of foes.</P>
